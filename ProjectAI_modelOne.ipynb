The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.\\nThe second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.\\nI think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver. So, I think that we should thoroughly study the historical experience and use its conclusions in our present life.\",\n          \"The bar chart illustrates the number of minutes of telephone calls in Australia, made to various localities or devices, from 2001 to 2008.\\nOver the course of the eight years during which the data was sampled, it can be noted that the number of phone call minutes made to mobile phones has increased by the greatest proportion. In 2001, 2 billion minutes worth of phone call time was recorded. By 2008, this number had increased exponentially to 46 billion minutes.\\nThe bar chart illustrates that between the years 2001 and 2005, the number of phone calls made to local numbers gradually increased. However, from 2006, these calls decreased steadily until 2008, with a number that is only slightly higher than national and international calling minutes.\\nThe number of phone call minutes made to national as well as international locations consistently increased in the allocated time frame.\\nIt is also clear that local telephone calls account for the majority of phone calls made in Australia, and telephone calls made to mobile phones account for the least.\\nIn summary, the number of telephone call minutes made in Australia in different categories, varied during the years 2001 to 2008.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Examiner_Commen\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 62,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"This essay covers the task.

Finally, we would use the testing set, which will be the unbiased evaluation set, we wont use it until we done with the training.\n"

            "Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. [SEP] Some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject. There are both pros and cons in this argument, which will be discussed in this essay.\n",
            "A tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education. Nowadays, more and more activists fight for women's rights. They want that every female can study everything that she prefers, notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not. Moreover, many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men. For example, when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men's play, a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men's subjects and work men's jobs. Therefore, the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women's intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study.\n",
            "On the other hand, some people can complain that this is discrimination against men. For instance, if every university will accept only 50% of men with the highest grades in every subject, men with average grades but higher than women's will not be accepted. Furthermore, this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities. Females also can do not want to learn every existing subject.\n",
            "In conclusion, the main point of equality in education is about choice, not coercion. From my point of view, that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects; if more boys prefer to be teachers, while more girls like to be scientists. However, this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist, and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality. 7.0\n"
