# Fine-Tuning-BERT-Automated-Essay-Scoring
The project investigates the use of a pre-trained NLP model (BERT) for automating essay scoring using a regression technique. We compared two approaches: 1) Fine-tuning BERT on IELTS essay responses with the prompt given to the students, and 2) Doing the same as approach 1 but with added custom features extracted from the dataset.
